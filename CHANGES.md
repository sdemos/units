Version 2.1
-----------

* Includes a decently comprehensive test suite.

* Add support for unit parsing within expressions:

      g = 9.8 % [si| m/s^2 |]

  See `Data.Metrology.UnitParser`.

* Now, `Data.Metrology` exports operators that work with the default
  LCSU. Use `Data.Metrology.Poly` to get the old, more flexible operators.

* Moved `showIn` from `Data.Metrology.Show` to `Data.Metrology.Poly`. This
  allows users to import `showIn` without a `Show` instance for quantities.

* Now, numeric operations are based on vector spaces, as implemented in
  the `vector-space` library. This changes the type signature of a few functions,
  and users writing their own combinators may need to update.

* Some documentation cleanup.

* New function `evalType` that evaluates a type, using Template Haskell. This
  allows for easier instance declarations for quantities.

* New class `Quantity` that allows for easy conversions with non-`units` types.

Version 2.0
-----------

This is a major update. `units` now supports the notion of a local unit set
and of separable dimensions and units. See the description in the
[draft paper](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2014/units/units.pdf) for
more info.

This update will very likely break any code that used `units-1.x`.

The update was written in partnership with Takayuki Muranushi.
